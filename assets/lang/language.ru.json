  "aboutContent": "Why did I bother to build this? \r\nI had really been enjoying playing around with Flutter and had decided to set up a template for a future project I had in mind. It was going to be a website and mobile app with one code base written in Flutter. I got the project working but it felt pointless since the game I was writing it for was only going to be released in a year, so I decided to test my template skills on Scrap Mechanic, to see how long it would take me to get a working app and website\r\n\r\nP.S.
